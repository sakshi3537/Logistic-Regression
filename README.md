# Logistic-Regression
# Recognition of digits using Logistic regression
Since logistic regression can solve classification problems effectively,So here, we are using it to predict the handwritten digits.
Dataset is loaded from sklearn.dataset and the model is trained with 77% of the total images and the rest 23% is left for testing.While checking the accuracy of the model, it was 94% accurate.
